          <p>This system utilizes a three layered version of the N-Tier architecture. Here, lower layers are providing
            the functionality to support layers above them.
            This architecture creates a dependency amongst the components where the lower layered components need to be
            built before the
            ones in higher layers. Given these conditions, we will divide the system build into three distinct phases,
            each corresponding
            to a layer according to the system architecture.
          </p>
          <p>Dividing the testing process into different phases will help with the overall process and allow it to build
            and mature along with the system.
            Additionally, it will allow for automation opportunities which can lead to continuous integration, where all
            changes are integrated immediately
            using automated pipeline and is built, packaged and tested. This ensures integration issues are caught and
            resolved early in the development process.
          </p>
          <p>Following this approach, we will start our test process from the lowest most layer which is Database or
            data access layer, moving to application programming
            interface layer and finally proceeding to presentation or graphical user interface layer. Since we are
            following the path of dependency between these layers,
            we will be able to solidify the foundations for higher layers by testing the lower layers first. These will
            be the three build phases we will test:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Data Access Layer:</b> Within Data access layer, we will focus on testing data access objects,
              ensuring they are functioning as intended.
              We would also focus on testing security & performance aspects of the database.</li>
            <li><b>API Layer:</b> Testing efforts will be focussed on security testing as well as functional testing to
              ensure
              APIs are functioning per specification and are secure. Since APIs will be exposed to external world via a
              programming interface,
              more focus on security is needed.</li>
            <li><b>Presentation Layer:</b> Within Presentation layer, we will focus on functional and accessibility
              aspects of the GUI. We would also be
              testing the performance of the system to ensure it complies with the non-functional requirements.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Test Procedure</h2>
          <p>
            Integration testing data access layer is very important, partly due to the fact that most of the unit tests
            do not cover
            database as it is considered an external system and with unit tests we want them to be as much independent
            as possible so they
            can be executed while external components may or may not have been built yet. This is an important
            consideration since it
            creates the possibility of discovering significant defects which may not have been uncovered yet due to lack
            of unit testing.
            Additionally, since data access layer is the bottom most layer, other layers are inherently dependent on
            proper functioning of
            data access layer. Any lingering defects could become very hard to investigate post integration with high
            layers.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have two different components here that need to be tested as part of the integration testing, with
            database being
            the more complex component and hence most of our effort will be spend testing database during this phase.
            The core
            theme of all our test cases will be around these four facts:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Data Mapping: </b>We need to ensure the fields within the data access layer are mapped consistently
                with the corresponding fields in the database.</li>
              <li><b>Data Integrity: </b>Data should be consistent with every database transaction.</li>
              <li><b>ACID Properties: </b>It stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
                Every database transaction should confirm to these four properties.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Test Procedure</h2>
          <p>Our next build focusses on API layer. This layer houses all the business logic and thus is critical
            in validation of the functional requirements. In fact, most of the functional requirements are also
            partially testable programmatically via the APIs. Every test case executed against the api should
            be verified at minimum against the specification for following:
            <ul>
              <li>Correct HTTP Status Code</li>
              <li>Correct HTTP Response Headers</li>
              <li>Correct HTTP Response Payload</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            During this build, we will test focus on following testing methodologies as part of our
            API testing strategy:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Functional Testing: </b>To ensure all functionality has been implemented as intended</li>
              <li><b>Security Testing: </b>To ensure authentication and authorization has been properly implemented</li>
              <li><b>Performance Testing: </b>To ensure we meet the performance SLAs as specified</li>
              <li><b>Load Testing: </b>To ensure we continue to function within SLAs when under load</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Test Cases</h2>
          <p>We have split the test cases for API testing according to the goal of a particular strategy.
            This helps us to organize our test cases and execute them together.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Functional Testing</h4>
          <p>Functional Testing usually involves ensuring the
            service contracts are correctly defined and apis are functioning acorrding to specification. We will
